# Minigame-project
## About this repository

This repository contains the core C# scripts of a minigame originally
developed as part of a larger private Unity project.

Due to project dependencies and intellectual property restrictions,
only the gameplay logic scripts are shared here. A gameplay video
demonstrating the complete minigame in context is linked below.
